# PowerBIBasics

I have worked on this project while taking the course from Coursera, Microsoft PowerBI Data Analyst. This project includes all the necessary basic aspects of Power BI such as creating report, various charts, KPIs, QnAs, etc. I have learnt and created from scratch which also helped me clear PI-300 with flying colors.
